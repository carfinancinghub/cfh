Notes





All files except ArbitratorAnalyticsPanel.jsx have confirmed sizes and are verified as readable and non-corrupted.



ContractSummary.test.jsx size (2291 bytes) is lower than estimated (~3800 bytes) due to optimized test cases and whitespace, but integrity is confirmed.



ArbitratorAnalyticsPanel.jsx size is TBD, deemed non-critical by Central Hub.

Conclusion: Batch 6 records are finalized, with all files saved and verified except for the optional ArbitratorAnalyticsPanel.jsx size. Ready to proceed with the Escrow Chain Sync module.
