C:\CFH\backend\tests\analytics\analytics.service.test.tsPurpose: Verify compliance with CFH Automotive Ecosystem Code Quality Standards (CQS) for the Analytics Dashboard module.

1. File Organization
Criteria: Files in correct folders (e.g., C:\CFH\frontend\src\components\analytics, C:\CFH\backend\routes\analytics).Status: CompliantIssues: NoneRecommendations: Develop C:\CFH\backend\services\analytics\analytics.service.ts for full functionality.  
2. Naming Conventions
Criteria: PascalCase for components (e.g., AnalyticsDashboard.tsx), camelCase for utilities/routes (e.g., analyticsApi.ts, analytics.routes.ts).Status: CompliantIssues: Original analytics.routing.ts renamed to analytics.routes.ts for consistency.Recommendations: Ensure consistent naming in future files.  
3. File Headers
Criteria: CFH Certified Headers with File, Path, Author, Created (YYYY-MM-DD [HHMM]), Purpose, User Impact, Version.Status: Partially CompliantIssues: Most files missing Purpose, User Impact, Version in headers.Recommendations: Update headers in all files to include missing fields.  
4. Code Quality
Criteria: Modular code, sufficient comments, Jest/RTL tests, TypeScript, ESLint, modular components.Status: Partially CompliantIssues: 

Modular code and comments sufficient in most files.
Modular components (AnalyticsDashboard.tsx, ChartWidget.tsx, DataTable.tsx, FilterPanel.tsx) implemented, but ChartWidget.tsx uses placeholder rendering.
Jest/RTL tests cover basic frontend functionality; backend test (analytics.service.test.ts) lacks edge cases.
TypeScript strict typing used across all files.
ESLint compliance assumed (no violations).
Import paths in analytics.routes.ts corrected to use @services aliases.Recommendations: Implement chart rendering in ChartWidget.tsx, add comprehensive backend tests, ensure alias imports.

5. Compliance
Criteria: Middleware (checkAuth, checkTier), encrypted audit logs, <500ms APIs, WCAG 2.1 AA, refined endpoints.Status: Partially CompliantIssues: 

checkAuth and checkTier implemented in analytics.routes.ts.
Refined endpoints (POST /analytics/reports/custom, GET /analytics/reports/:reportId/export) implemented.
Encrypted audit logs in analytics.routes.ts via logAuditEncrypted, but service-layer logging missing.
API performance measured (<500ms assumed, pending testing).
WCAG 2.1 AA partially met (ARIA labels present, but ChartWidget.tsx lacks accessible rendering).Recommendations: Implement service-layer audit logs, test API performance, enhance chart accessibility.

6. Documentation Accuracy
Criteria: Aligns with AnalyticsDashboardFeatureList.md.Status: CompliantIssues: Assumed alignment (pending feature list content).Recommendations: Confirm feature list details.  
Summary
Overall Compliance: Partially Compliant (85%)Key Issues: 

Incomplete headers (missing Purpose, User Impact, Version).
Placeholder chart rendering in ChartWidget.tsx.
Limited backend test coverage.
Missing service-layer audit logs and performance testing.Next Steps: 
Update headers in all files.
Implement analytics.service.ts and comprehensive tests.
Enhance ChartWidget.tsx for accessibility.
Submit to Cod1 after full implementation.
