Overview
The haulerBucket.ts utility, located at frontend/src/archive/hauler/haulerBucket.ts, is an archived module for managing a bucket of hauler-related data, such as aggregated transport history or preferences. It supports historical analytics and is designed for potential revival in future features like MarketplaceInsightsDashboard.
