Generated Features Documentation
This document outlines the generated TypeScript (.ts and .tsx) files based on the requirements from the docs/features/ Markdown files, including their functionality, tiered features, CQS (Compliance, Quality, Security), and error handling. These files represent the culmination of the Phase 2.5 refinement process.
Requirements

All files are implemented as TypeScript modules, transitioning from the original JavaScript (.js, .jsx) specifications.
Each file corresponds to a specific feature or service defined in the associated .md file, with paths matching the project structure (e.g., C:\CFH\frontend\src\components\tinting\, C:\CFH\backend\routes\tinting\).
Include tiered features (Free, Standard, Premium, Wow++), CQS, and error handling as specified.

Usage

These components and services are integrated into the CFH application, accessible based on user subscription tiers.
Use the exported classes or components with the provided props/methods to interact with the functionality.

Notes

All files include placeholder implementations for unimplemented dependencies (e.g., Redis, SendGrid, bcrypt).
Future development should integrate real APIs, databases, and third-party services as indicated by TODO comments.
Verify paths and dependencies during deployment (e.g., npm install ioredis winston bcrypt jsonwebtoken @sendgrid/mail bull express-rate-limit --save).
The file TintingServiceDiscovery.tsx was added to complete the window tinting section.
File locations are based on the latest PowerShell output (2025-06-30) and may need adjustment for different environments.
